# Project Initiation Document: Exploreon

## 1. Project Definition
    - **Project Name:** Exploreon
    - **Project Vision/Purpose:** Exploreon is an experience verification platform that combines World ID biometric verification, dynamic QR codes, and semi-fungible tokens (SFTs) to prove authentic human presence at events and locations. Users can collect and showcase digital proof of their real-world experiences, from attending concerts to completing unique adventures, all verified through secure biometric technology.
    - **Core Concept:** A digital proof-of-experience platform that verifies and rewards real human presence at events and locations. Users prove their attendance through World ID biometric verification and dynamic QR codes, receiving unique digital tokens as verifiable proof of their experiences.

## 2. Objectives
    - Develop a platform for biometric experience verification using World ID.
    - Enable users to collect unique Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs) as verifiable proof of their experiences.
    - Integrate with a variety of events, venues, and experience providers.
    - Achieve a high rate of verified experiences.
    - Grow an active user base engaged in collecting and sharing experiences.
    - Establish partnerships with event organizers and technology providers.
    - Ensure a high verification success rate and system uptime.

## 3. Scope
    - **Core Functionality:**
        - World ID Integration: Biometric verification, proof of unique humanity, privacy-preserving protocol.
        - Dynamic QR System: Time-sensitive, location-specific QR codes with one-time use validation.
        - Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs): ERC-1155 standard for digital proof of experience, including unique attendance metadata and timestamps.
        - User Profiles: Allow users to showcase collected SFTs and experiences.
        - Experience Flow: Covering pre-experience (discovery, setup), on-site verification, and post-experience (SFT reception, sharing).
        - Use Cases: Event attendance (concerts, festivals), unique experiences (adventure activities), exclusive access (special venues), achievement tracking (personal milestones).
    - **Out of Scope (Initial MVP):**
        - Advanced social networking features beyond sharing SFTs.
        - A complex marketplace for trading SFTs.
        - Support for all types of global events initially (focus on specific partner categories).
        - Offline verification capabilities.

## 4. Stakeholders
    - **Project Lead/Owner:** Exploreon Team Lead
    - **Development Team:** AI Agent (Jules)
    - **Target Users:** Event-goers and festival attendees, Adventure seekers, Experience collectors, Social media enthusiasts, Digital collectors.
    - **Potential Partners:**
        - Event Partners: Music festivals, Sports events, Cultural venues, Adventure companies, Educational institutions.
        - Technology Partners: Ticketing platforms, Event management systems, Social media platforms, Digital wallet providers, Experience marketplaces.

## 5. Project Justification
    - **Problem/Opportunity:** There is a need for a secure and verifiable way to prove authentic human presence at experiences, combating fraudulent claims and enhancing the value of real-world attendance. This creates an opportunity for users to collect unique digital memorabilia (SFTs) that are undeniably linked to their experiences.
    - **Unique Selling Points:**
        - Biometric verification ensures authentic human presence.
        - Tamper-proof experience verification.
        - Digital collectibles (SFTs) as proof of attendance.
        - Social sharing and bragging rights.
        - Integration with major events and venues.

## 6. Assumptions
    - The technology stack will involve blockchain (ERC-1155 for SFTs), mobile/web components for user interaction, and robust backend services for QR generation, verification, and token minting.
    - World ID integration is technically feasible and will provide the necessary level of secure, privacy-preserving biometric verification.
    - Users will be willing to use World ID biometric verification for accessing and proving valuable or unique experiences.
    - Event organizers and experience providers will see value in partnering to offer verified experiences.

## 7. Constraints
    - Initial development timeline: Phase 1 (Foundation) estimated at 1-2 months, followed by subsequent phases for core features, enhancement, and launch.
    - Dependency on the availability and reliability of external systems, particularly World ID.
    - Adherence to legal and privacy regulations related to biometric data and user information, as outlined in "Legal Considerations."
    - Resource limitations for a broad initial rollout, necessitating a focused approach to target markets and partners.

## 8. Initial Risks & Mitigation
    - **Risk:** Technical complexity of seamlessly integrating World ID, dynamic QR code generation/validation, and blockchain SFT minting.
        - **Mitigation:** Phased development approach as outlined in the roadmap, rigorous testing of each component, potentially engaging specialized expertise for blockchain and World ID integration.
    - **Risk:** User adoption challenges related to biometric verification and understanding the value of SFTs.
        - **Mitigation:** Clear user education on the benefits (security, exclusivity, verifiable proof) and privacy safeguards of World ID. Focus on high-value, desirable experiences to incentivize adoption.
    - **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts, QR code system, or user data handling.
        - **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to security best practices in development, comprehensive smart contract audits, QR code encryption, and robust data protection measures. Implement measures like rate limiting and emergency pause for smart contracts.
    - **Risk:** Dependence on partner adoption for a wide range of verifiable experiences.
        - **Mitigation:** Develop a clear value proposition for partners, focusing on enhanced engagement, security, and new revenue/marketing opportunities. Start with a few key partners to build case studies.

## 9. High-Level Roadmap Overview
    - **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2):** Focus on World ID integration, dynamic QR system development, and basic smart contract (ERC-1155) setup.
    - **Phase 2: Core Features (Months 3-4):** Implement SFT minting and management, complete the verification flow, and build the experience tracking system.
    - **Phase 3: Enhancement (Months 5-6):** Develop social sharing features, integrate with initial partners, and build community tools.
    - **Phase 4: Launch (Month 7):** Conduct a public beta, launch with initial events, and focus on community building activities.
